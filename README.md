This project is my bachelor's thesis. The point is to predict the toxicity of magnetite nanoparticles using predictors: the parameter of the elementary cell, which was calculated using
1) peak with a Miller index of 440.
2)python tsfel library predictors.
The following algorithms were used: "knn", "gradient boosting", "decision tree"; and "random forest" for for solving a regression problem.
The accuracy of the regression task and prediction of the toxicity class is low due to the small sample.
I examined more than 80 samples, but only 20 fit. The criterion was the unit cell parameter range (8.2-8.9).
This work will continue.
